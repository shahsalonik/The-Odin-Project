    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Tacos, a cornerstone of Mexican cuisine, are a vibrant and versatile dish deeply embedded in the country's culinary traditions. 
        Traditionally, tacos consist of small, soft corn tortillas filled with a variety of ingredients, ranging from seasoned meats like carne asada and al pastor to flavorful vegetables and beans. 
        Tacos are often garnished with fresh cilantro, diced onions, and a squeeze of lime, enhancing their bright and zesty flavors. 
        Regional variations abound in Mexico, with coastal areas favoring seafood tacos, while inland regions might feature rich, slow-cooked stews like barbacoa. 
        This diversity reflects the rich tapestry of Mexican culture and the adaptability of the taco as a culinary vehicle.

        Globally, tacos have transcended their traditional roots to become a beloved street food and a staple in international cuisine, continually evolving to incorporate local tastes and ingredients. 
        In the United States, for instance, the concept of the taco has expanded to include hard shell tacos, flour tortillas, and a wide array of fillings such as grilled vegetables, fish, and fusion creations like Korean barbecue tacos. 
        Taco trucks and restaurants offer endless customization options, allowing for a personal and interactive dining experience. 
        This adaptability has led to the taco's immense popularity, as it caters to diverse dietary preferences and culinary innovations, making it a dish that is both deeply traditional and continuously evolving.
